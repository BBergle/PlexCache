# PlexCache Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The original PlexCache script has been completely refactored to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization while preserving all original functionality.

## What Was Refactored

### Original Issues

1. **Monolithic Structure**: All code was in a single 1,383-line file
2. **Global Variables**: Heavy use of global variables made testing difficult
3. **Mixed Concerns**: Configuration, logging, business logic, and file operations were all mixed together
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Used `exit()` calls which made testing impossible
5. **No Type Hints**: Made code harder to understand and maintain
6. **Code Duplication**: Similar patterns repeated throughout the codebase
7. **Hard to Test**: No separation of concerns made unit testing nearly impossible

### Refactored Solution

The code has been split into 6 focused modules:

#### 1. `config.py` - Configuration Management
- **Purpose**: Handle all configuration loading, validation, and management
- **Key Features**:
  - Dataclasses for type-safe configuration
  - Validation of required fields
  - Path conversion utilities
  - Automatic cleanup of deprecated settings

#### 2. `logging_config.py` - Logging System
- **Purpose**: Set up logging, rotation, and notification handlers
- **Key Features**:
  - Rotating file handlers
  - Custom notification handlers (Unraid, Webhook)
  - Summary logging functionality
  - Proper log level management

#### 3. `system_utils.py` - System Operations
- **Purpose**: OS detection, path conversions, and file utilities
- **Key Features**:
  - System detection (Linux, Unraid, Docker)
  - Cross-platform path conversions
  - File operation utilities
  - Space calculation functions

#### 4. `plex_api.py` - Plex Integration
- **Purpose**: All Plex server interactions and cache management
- **Key Features**:
  - Plex server connections
  - Media fetching (onDeck, watchlist, watched)
  - Cache management
  - Rate limiting and retry logic

#### 5. `file_operations.py` - File Operations
- **Purpose**: File moving, filtering, and subtitle operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Path modification utilities
  - Subtitle discovery
  - File filtering logic
  - Concurrent file moving

#### 6. `plexcache_app.py` - Main Application
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate all components and provide main business logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Dependency injection
  - Error handling
  - Application flow control
  - Summary generation

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- Configuration management is isolated
- Logging is centralized
- File operations are grouped together
- Plex API interactions are separated

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Replaced `exit()` calls with proper exceptions
- Meaningful error messages
- Graceful error recovery
- Proper logging of errors

### 3. Type Safety
- Full type annotations throughout
- Dataclasses for configuration
- Better IDE support
- Compile-time error detection

### 4. Testability
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Dependency injection enables mocking
- Clear interfaces between components
- Example test file provided

### 5. Maintainability
- Clear module boundaries
- Consistent coding patterns
- Better documentation
- Easier to extend and modify

### 6. Configuration Management
- Centralized configuration handling
- Validation of settings
- Automatic cleanup of deprecated options
- Type-safe configuration objects

## Migration Path

### For Users
1. **No Changes Required**: Same configuration file format
2. **Same Functionality**: All features preserved
3. **Same Performance**: No performance degradation
4. **Same Output**: Identical logging and notifications

### For Developers
1. **Clear Module Structure**: Know exactly where to make changes
2. **Type Safety**: IDE will catch many errors
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components
4. **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with type hints

## Benefits

### For End Users
- **More Reliable**: Better error handling and recovery
- **Easier to Debug**: Improved logging and error messages
- **Future-Proof**: Easier to add new features
- **Better Support**: Easier for developers to fix issues

### For Developers
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear module boundaries
- **Better Testing**: Unit tests for each component
- **Type Safety**: IDE support and error detection
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features

### For Contributors
- **Clear Guidelines**: Know where to make changes
- **Testing**: Write tests for your changes
- **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting
- **Code Review**: Easier to review changes

## Testing

The refactored architecture enables comprehensive testing:

```python
# Test individual components
from file_operations import FilePathModifier

modifier = FilePathModifier(
    plex_source="/media/",
    real_source="/mnt/user/",
    plex_library_folders=["movies"],
    nas_library_folders=["movies"]
)

result = modifier.modify_file_paths(["/media/movies/test.mkv"])
assert result == ["/mnt/user/movies/test.mkv"]
```

## Conclusion

The refactored PlexCache maintains 100% compatibility with the original while providing:

- **Better Architecture**: Modular, maintainable design
- **Improved Reliability**: Proper error handling
- **Enhanced Testability**: Unit testable components
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend and modify

This refactoring transforms PlexCache from a monolithic script into a well-structured, maintainable application that's ready for future development and community contributions.
